# BET 2026 SUB075 regional-scaling sensitivities

This branch contains sixteen NOCUT MFCL models based on
**PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-bet-2026-exploration@81a456fa5c36ef1be5bd9da38308ef07ebc55ff4** (**experiment/normal-francis-initial-20260719**). All models use the SUB075
age-length input and corrected SA28-N5 selectivity baseline. CUT90 is excluded.
The retained Job 5319 FRQ already contains the selected 2026 effort-creep
adjustment, and the build never reapplies effort creep.

## Model design

| IDs | LF likelihood and weighting | Tag flag column 2 | REGW sequence |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| S001-S004 | Robust normal; F21/F22/F23 DW10 | 0 (OFF) | 50, 11, 1, 0 |
| S005-S008 | Robust normal; F21/F22/F23 DW10 | 1 (ON) | 50, 11, 1, 0 |
| S009-S012 | DM G5PROC-CEST; Nmax20 | 0 (OFF) | 50, 11, 1, 0 |
| S013-S016 | DM G5PROC-CEST; Nmax20 | 1 (ON) | 50, 11, 1, 0 |

The four REGW values occur in the displayed order within every ID range. This
gives matched comparisons for LF likelihood, tag flag column 2, and regional-
scaling weight. Within each OFF/ON pair, all 98 values in tag flag column 2
change from 0 to 1; the other INI fields and model data are unchanged.

For robust-normal models, DW10 means F21/F22/F23 flag-49 divisor 200 against
the global divisor 20. It is not applied to DM models because fixed flag-49
divisors are not the DM observation-weight parameter. For DM models, Nmax20 is
the phase-1 maximum LF sample-size control. It is not a statement that the
realized effective sample size is exactly 20; realized information also
depends on the estimated DM concentration and relative sample-size exponent.

## Regional-scaling weights

| REGW | Effective covariance | Standardized SD multiplier | Role in this design |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 50 | Sigma / 50 | 0.1414 | Inherited strong constraint |
| 11 | Sigma / 11 | 0.3015 | Intermediate constraint |
| 1 | Sigma | 1.0000 | Empirical covariance without an extra precision multiplier |
| 0 | Not applicable | Not applicable | Regional-scaling penalty disabled |

The active regional-scaling data are 20 quarterly regional CPUE values for
1965-1969. MFCL converts each row to regional proportions, calculates their
mean and covariance, removes Region 5 as the MVN reference dimension, and uses

    penalty = 0.5 * weight * d' * Sigma^-1 * d.

Thus weights 50, 11, and 1 give standardized SD multipliers of 0.1414,
0.3015, and 1.0000 relative to the empirical MVN covariance; weight 0 disables
the regional-scaling penalty. These are penalty-strength interpretations, not
literal CVs on regional biomass or on each regional target mean.

The derivation, source/manual references, and distinction from target-relative
marginal CV are documented in
**notes/regional-scaling-weight-interpretation.md**.
